                    This café is a place that reminds us of the interesting stories of our adventures in Surabaya. We visited this place spontaneously, without any prior planning. It also reminds me (Izzan) of my first meeting with my girlfriend (Hana) when she visited Surabaya for the first time to see me.

                    Having a concept entirely different from other cafes, it piqued our interest and we felt compelled to visit this place. Shortly after completing a long journey from Madura, this café became a fair destination for us to enjoy the late afternoon while sipping coffee and taking a break from the hustle and bustle of the city.

                    We were truly delighted when we visited this place. Even if asked whether we would visit again, of course, we would visit hundreds of times more.
