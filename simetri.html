                    SIMETRI Coffee is the place where we first met, and it holds a special significance for both of us. Every time we go to this place, it's always just the two of us. To us, this place is sacred because it's where all our stories began.

                    Back then, we decided to meet at this place because SIMETRI Coffee has a very strategic location and can be considered romantic. So we made this place the setting for the first step in our relationship. Located next to the lake, it's the main charm of this place. Although it's relatively expensive, this place has a spacious enough area to accommodate many people at once. While the price may be high, we believe that the taste of every dish served here justifies the money we spend.

                    This place is a silent witness to the meetings and farewells that we, as a couple in a long-distance relationship, often go through.
