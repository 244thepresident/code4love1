                This is a place that plays a very significant role and holds memorable memories in our relationship. BLKSWN Coffee is where we reunited after breaking up and not seeing each other for several months.

                This place also serves as the foundation for the harmonious relationship that we have been able to maintain until now. Without this place, perhaps we would never have reunited like we did in the past. In this place, we have learned many lessons from life itself. Laughter, tears, and cause and effect are all part of the life lessons we have gained here.
            
                The reason we often visit this place, both together and with other friends, is because of its strategic location and comfortable atmosphere. Although it is not large enough to accommodate many people, it is precisely this simplicity that reflects the charm of this place that we adore. This simplicity also adds to the comfort of this place.
